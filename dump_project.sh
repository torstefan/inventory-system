2. Browser compatibility issues with certain camera functions
3. Large image uploads need optimization
4. Need better error messages for API failures
5. Location selector can be slow with many locations
6. Search performance could be improved for large datasets

## Technical Debt
1. Need comprehensive test coverage
2. API documentation needs updating
3. Performance optimization for image processing
4. Code documentation improvements
5. Type safety enhancements
6. Error handling standardization
7. Search query optimization
8. React component restructuring

## Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Implement search within filtered results
2. Add sorting capabilities
3. Improve filter performance
4. Add batch operations
5. Implement dark mode
6. Add keyboard shortcuts
7. Create analytics dashboard
