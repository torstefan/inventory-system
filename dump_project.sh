Project: Smart Inventory Management System with Computer Vision and LLM Integration

This is a web-based inventory management system designed to help organize electronic components and items in a storage space. The system uses both computer vision (GPT-4V) and text description (GPT-4) to identify items and suggest storage locations.

Key Features:
1. Multi-Modal Item Registration
   - Camera capture with manual focus and preference memory
   - Text-based item description processing
   - GPT-4V for image analysis
   - GPT-4 for text analysis
   - Voice input support (Chrome/Chromium browsers)

2. Intelligent Item Classification
   - Automatic category and subcategory detection
   - Technical description generation
   - Use case identification
   - Brand and model recognition
   - Condition assessment

3. Storage Management
   - Three-level storage hierarchy:
     * Level 1: Shelves
     * Level 2: Containers/Organizers
     * Level 3: Compartments
   - Location suggestions with reasoning
   - Alternative location recommendations
   - Full CRUD operations for storage locations

4. Inventory Management
   - Comprehensive item database
   - Expandable item details view
   - Technical specifications display
   - Use case documentation
   - Location tracking
   - Edit and update capabilities
   - Bulk operations support

Technical Stack:
Frontend:
- Next.js 13+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Webcam for camera integration
- WebSpeech API for voice input
- Recharts for data visualization
- Axios for API communication

Backend:
- Flask (Python)
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- SQLite database
- OpenAI GPT-4V and GPT-4 integration
- REST API architecture

Current State:
âœ… Implemented:
- Basic UI and navigation
- Camera capture with manual focus
- Text-based item processing
- Voice input functionality
- Storage location management
- Item database with CRUD operations
- Technical descriptions and use cases
- Location suggestions
- Expandable item view

ðŸš§ In Progress:
- Search functionality
- Sorting and filtering
- Image gallery view
- Statistical analysis
- Bulk operations

ðŸ“‹ Planned Features:
1. Enhanced Search
   - Full-text search
   - Category filtering
   - Location-based search
   - Technical specification search

2. Data Management
   - Import/Export functionality
   - Backup system
   - Data validation
   - Duplicate detection

3. Analytics
   - Storage usage statistics
   - Item category distribution
   - Location optimization
   - Movement tracking

4. User Interface
   - Dark mode support
   - Mobile optimization
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Customizable views

5. Item Tracking
   - Movement history
   - Usage logs
   - Condition tracking
   - Location history

Installation Requirements:
Backend:
- Python 3.11+
- Flask 3.0.0+
- SQLAlchemy 2.0.23+
- OpenAI API key
- Other dependencies in requirements.txt

Frontend:
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Webcam (optional)
- Microphone (optional)

Setup Instructions:
1. Backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python init_db.py
   python app.py
   ```

2. Frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

Known Issues:
1. Manual focus control requires camera reinitialization
2. Voice recognition limited to Chromium browsers
3. Location selector can be slow with many locations
4. Some cameras may not support manual focus
5. Text processing may need multiple attempts for complex items

Next Steps:
1. Implement search functionality
2. Add sorting and filtering to item list
3. Implement image gallery view
4. Add usage statistics
5. Create backup system
6. Add batch operations
7. Improve error handling
8. Add input validation
9. Implement dark mode
10. Add keyboard shortcuts
