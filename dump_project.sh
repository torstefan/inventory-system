## Known Issues 🐛
1. Need better error handling for network connectivity issues
2. Some browser compatibility issues with camera functions
3. Large image uploads need optimization
4. Need better error messages for GPT processing failures
5. Location selector can be slow with many locations
6. Search performance could be improved for large datasets

## Technical Debt
1. Need test coverage
2. Improve error handling
3. Performance optimization for image processing
4. Code documentation
5. API versioning
6. Search query optimization
7. Better type safety in frontend components

## Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Implement search filters
2. Add sorting capabilities to search
3. Add export functionality
4. Improve error handling
5. Add batch operations
6. Implement dark mode
7. Add keyboard shortcuts

## Environment Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- SQLite 3.40+
- OpenAI API key
- Webcam with V4L2 support
- v4l2-ctl utility installed
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
